# Needs an update in files:

- Profile: Able to edit user's info
- HomeOut: Create validation if fields are empty & new function that calls dispatch in this new function
- Money: Not display all movements and change functionality in case user doesn't have movements at all
- HeaderLogOut: Get user by fetching it instead of getting it from the users vaiable
- App: Don't get all users when component first displayed

## What needs to change:

- currentUser: Get current user from useParams(id). Needs to replace this on Profile, HeaderLogIn, HomeLinks, Money and App components.

/////////////////////////////////////////////// DONE

- HeaderLoggedIn & Out, change the way to sign-in and out, example:
  ðŸ‘‡ in header logged in
  setLoggedIn(true);
  localStorage.setItem("userData", JSON.stringify(user));
  navigate("/");

  Create a dispatch using 'useImmer' or another 'useImmerReducer' to only call this funciton in both components
